# MovieRental

This is just a simple Movie Rental systen mockup used so that I don't forget how to do C#

There are 4 files that are used in the system. 
1) MovieList.csv which is where the List of Movies get stored.
2) Movie.cs a helper class to create movies.
3) MovieRentalSystem.cs which holds all the backend logic.
4) Program.cs which holds all the front end logic for the CLI
